With over 90 stores, Midland Park Mall® is the Permian Basin’s premier shopping destination. Enjoy convenient and stress-free shopping in shops like Victoria’s Secret, Aeropostale, Buckle, Ulta & Coach in a wonderful climate controlled indoor mall.

Visit the mall management office for Simon Giftcards, complimentary wheelchair rentals, and top-notch customer service. Whether you enjoy shopping, making laps as a mall-walker or just sitting back to relax in one of our many sitting areas, Midland Park Mall is the place to be. Visit our Play Area in JCPenney Court !
